# Work Summary

This includes the work that I did during **Google Summer of Code 2022** at project **Phoenix** under org **CERN-HSF**.

1. Writing unit tests for the [`phoenix-event-display`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phoenix-event-display) library using Jest.
2. Migrating the unit tests for [`phoenix-app`](https://github.com/HSF/phoenix/tree/master/packages/phoenix-ng/projects/phoenix-app) (Phoenix application) and [`phoenix-ui-components`](https://github.com/HSF/phoenix/tree/master/packages/phoenix-ng/projects/phoenix-ui-components) (UI components used by the Phoenix application) to Jest from Jasmine and Karma.
