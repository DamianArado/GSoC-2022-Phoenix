# Project Progress Tracker 

Here, I will log the weekly progress. This will updated twice a week - on Monday and Thursday.  

### Week 1 (May 30 - June 6, 2022)  

- Read about the testing framework which is better to use (faster execution, easy configuration and maintenance) in order to refine the project plan
- Divide the project deliverables into smaller parts
- Finalize estimated deadlines and milestones
- Try to figure out potential issues that may occur beforehand
- Ask mentors whether they agree to the milestones and if they have any doubts (asking for feedback)
- Agree with mentors upon the way of communication throughout the project duration
