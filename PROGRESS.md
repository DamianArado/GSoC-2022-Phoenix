# Project Progress Tracker 

Here, I will log the weekly progress. This will be updated twice a week - on Monday and Thursday.  

### Week 1 (May 30 - June 6, 2022)  

- Introductory video chat between the mentors and me in order to get to know each other and the work we do
- Read about the testing framework which is better to use (faster execution, easy configuration and maintenance) in order to refine the project plan
- Divide the project deliverables into smaller parts
- Finalize estimated deadlines and milestones
- Try to figure out potential issues that may occur beforehand
- Ask Ed & Fawad whether they agree to the milestones and if they have any doubts/questions for me (asking for feedback)
- Agree with Ed & Fawad upon the way of communication throughout the project duration
